# Code architecture
This repository provides some code to build diverse types normalizing flow models in PyTorch. The core components are located in the **models** folder. The different flow models are described in the file **NormalizingFlow.py** and they all follow the structure of the parent **class NormalizingFlow**.
A flow step is usually designed as a combination of a **normalizer** (such as the ones described in Normalizers sub-folder) with a **conditioner** (such as the ones described in Conditioners sub-folder). Following the code hierarchy provided makes the implementation of new conditioners, normalizers or even complete flow architecture very easy.
# Paper's experiments
## UCI Datasets
You first have to download the datasets with the following command:
```bash
python UCIdatasets/download_dataset.py 
```
Then you can run the experiment of your choice with the following command:
```bash
python UCIExperiments.py -load_config <exp-name>
```
where <exp-name> defines the experimental configuration loaded from *UCIExperimentsConfigurations.yml* file, e.g. *power-mono-DAG*.
See also UCIExperiments.py for other optional arguments.
